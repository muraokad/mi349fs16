Website Draft

The website will be a portfolio for David Muraoka as well as an official website for the games that I have made. 
There will be three main sections for the website: the first page, the contact/information page, and the games/download page. 
The first page will consist of a “welcome” header which will give very basic information about myself and what this website is all about. 
This will help make it clear if the user is in the right place for what they are looking for. 
It will also show some images of the games I’ve worked on to give an impression of the game I’ve made if anyone is interested. 
Below that will give more details on the games I’ve made and links to where they can be downloaded.
The information page will be a rough summary about who I am and how to get all the information the user is looking for. 
It will expand on the basic information presented on the first page and give links to both my resume and how to contact me. 
The download page will be the main page where all the games that I have made will be held. 
It will have details about each game as well as download links to them.
